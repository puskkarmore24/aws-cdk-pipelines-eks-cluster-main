## CDK Pipelines for EKS Cluster(s)

## Overview

This project uses CDK Pipelines to define a self mutating pipeline to deploy EKS Cluster(s) to perform tasks like: cluster upgrade, replicate clusters consistently across environments/accounts and etc. It uses CDK for cluster, node, infrastructure and app configuration.

### Pipeline

This is the pipeline generated by CDK Pipelines with the following stages: Source, Build, UpdatePipeline, Assets, DeployEKSClusters

## Deployment

To deploy the pipeline for the first time, you'll need a GitHub secret name `github-oauth-token` in your Secrets Manager and then you can deploy it using `cdk deploy`. After the first deploy, any change that you push to your Git Repository will update the Pipeline and execute.
